		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m fortunate enough that I have already seen a few companies just exploding in growth. It&rsquo;s exhilarating and exhausting. Using &ldquo;exploding&rdquo; is not figurative speech, it is quite literal since everything starts to blow up. &#x1f4a5;<br>
		<br>
		Reid Hoffman has a good story on the feeling of when this starts to happen:</span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span><br>
		&ldquo;</span><span class="c9">In early 2000, payment transaction volume was growing at a compounding rate of 2% to 5% per day. That kind of growth put PayPal in a deep hole as far as customer service was concerned. Even though the only place we listed our contact information was in the Palo Alto phone directory, angry customers were tracking down our main number and dialing extensions at random. Twenty-four hours a day, you could pick up literally any phone and talk to an angry customer.&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You hit right in the nail of product/market fit, customers are just running to you and taking the product from your hands. This is an amazing feeling, but now everything else seems to start to crumble. Support team crashes, too many users waiting on you to sign up / onboard, maintenance tasks and bug issues are spiralling out of control...Your growth, your unit economics and your customer loyalty starts to suffer since your business is no longer satisfying it&rsquo;s initial promises. You&rsquo;ve found out how to launch the rocket but now every piece of it is cracking.</span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span><br>
		So in the midst of the chaos, you&rsquo;re ready to start scaling and you want to make sure the rocket keeps flying so you ask the question:</span> <span class="c3">how many people do we need?</span> <span class="c0">And this is where the first denial in scaling your operations starts.</span></p>
		<h2 class="c10" id="h.njvm42ayg6op"><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need more people, we can do this!&rdquo;</span></h2>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Startups have many heroes. People who go above and beyond to try to unlockthe company&#39;s fate. Operations has its fair share of them since it&rsquo;s clear what it&#39;s needed to sacrifice to achieve the outcomes: time in manual tasks - &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just do this stretch!&rdquo;. If the operational work is done asynchronously, like tasks, reviews or answering emails, teams usually look at this &ldquo;david vs. goliath&rdquo; story of the operational team versus the evil &ldquo;Backlog!&rdquo;. Due to lack of streamline of operational work the inbound of tasks will accumulate at some points in time but in the early days the team can just &ldquo;double down&rdquo;, schedule some pizza nights and get it done &#x1f4aa;(I will use the term tasks as an abstraction of the work units needed to be processed by the operations team).</span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>
		To a certain degree this is doable, but when you&rsquo;re hitting product market fit you&rsquo;re probably just patching a problem that you need to solve sustainably. When the energy of your operational workforce or capacity is already over stretched , companies will just try to overcompensate by bringing people from outside of operational teams to lend a hand and get things stable. Though if the rocket has truly lifted off, the issue will come back, repeatedly, to a point that if you leave unattended long enough there is no overcompensation that you can do.</span></p>
		<h2 class="c10" id="h.qie9qxdp0dhw"><span class="c6 c8">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the system, not the lack of people!&rdquo;</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Operations teams finally realise their limits as heroes. They share that they need to hire a few more people though they are saying that the biggest reason for the evil backlog to accumulate is just that processes and systems are deficient. Indeed the last time that the rest of the company helped &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the backlog, they&rsquo;ve identified a hundred different things that operations could have been doing better.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone agrees that this is a problem to be solved, though without much data to look at since there is none &#x1f648;. So the hunt starts for the best workflow/crm management platform. Some questions start to pop up: Is it Salesforce? Is it Zendesk? Is it a better internal tool? Shall we build everything in house or rely on vendors? This endeavour has much to it but in the end you go with something in the middle between a vendor and some back office tools - but who&rsquo;s going to this work? Yes you will have to eat up the capacity of your product team.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just spend a few sprints on this to get it up and running and integrated!&rdquo; or &ldquo;We can spare one engineer to get this going, while the rest of team can focus on the main effort&rdquo; This is a common pitfall, and usually by trying to &ldquo;half-ass&rdquo; this this ends up dragging over quarters and the operations team problems don&rsquo;t stop getting bigger.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t emphasise enough that if you&rsquo;re trying to solve this problem be purposeful and intentional about it. Scalability tasks are not sexy nor pretty and it&rsquo;s hard to get the team around these challenges, but they are needed. They are the foundations that enable and create options.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span>Don&rsquo;t go over the top too though. In some companies the reaction at this stage due to the recent wins in innovation that the company had is trying to innovate the space:</span> <span class="c3">&ldquo;we&rsquo;re just going to disrupt how support/operational work is done&rdquo;</span><span>. It seems natural for the company to do this since they are such disruptors and innovators - &ldquo;we do things differently at XYZ&rdquo; - but this is a distraction. Sachi Rehkin writes about this in this</span> <span class="c19"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sachinrekhi.com/the-best-startups-minimize-their-dimensions-of-innovation&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1612716849720000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0xOViw1FC7OKf8CIW1pBCc">article</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in a really solid way that startups should focus as much as possible on the dimensions where they are innovating and not be distracted by anything else. If it&rsquo;s not differentiating in any way startups/companies should just leverage best practices instead of trying to rediscover the wheel.</span></p>
		<h2 class="c10" id="h.31ssfaeqri6k"><span class="c8 c6">&ldquo;Why are we still getting backlogs? Show me the data?&rdquo;</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your shiny new workflow tool is in place. But you&rsquo;re still getting hammered with constant backlogs and customers getting annoyed. What&rsquo;s happening? Some colleagues are still pointing at your system and processes but you have now one thing though that you didn&rsquo;t have in the past that helps through the upcoming challenges: data!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The new workflow tool besides streamlining some tasks now also collects data from tasks and for the first time you can get a scary concept when you first start scaling operations: performance metrics. Indeed, it seems now you have visibility of each one of the people working in operations and you start to understand what drives efficiency and the top performers.<br>
		<br>
		What does this mean? You know, that a colleague that is well renowned for customers/colleagues really loving him, from the data though it seems his 2 times less productive than his peers &#x1f648;. What do you do?</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span>This period creates some difficult questions and decisions that will probably force a transformation of the culture of the company. Patrick Collinson on this interview talks about this:<br>
		<br></span><span class="c9">&ldquo;(...)The other failure mode, then, once you&rsquo;ve succeeded in being explicit enough about your culture, is becoming overly wedded to it. And this is the tension: you need to be explicit about what you are, but also willing to revisit it. One of the most difficult exercises in judgment that has to be applied by the leaders of a startup is continually balancing this tension.&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Scaling operations is not only about creating processes and systems, it&rsquo;s also shifting environments and cultures. In this case when you introduce metrics you introduce performance management.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Performance management introduces a big shift in culture shift in operational teams on startups. It might feel too cold and a bit &ldquo;corporatish&rdquo;, and I can&rsquo;t lie, it is quite different from the &ldquo;good old days when&hellip;&rdquo;. Done right though this let&rsquo;s us best support and develop operations employees, therefore increasing the leverage you have in your existing workforce.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This change though can&rsquo;t be done only by throwing metrics at people. It is paramount when you&rsquo;re tightening up monitoring you&rsquo;re doubling down at the same time on coaching. Team leads in conjunction on getting proficiency at reading their teams performance metrics, they need to spend time in developing their reports with regular coaching - only like this will you be able to have a smoother transition.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">With this new inflow of data you start finally understanding how work/load/tasks are flowing into your company and you know how much time is needed to process them. With this, you start changing how you&rsquo;re approaching hiring for operational roles, from reactive to proactive. You start to plot the inflow of tasks coming into the company into the future so you know who you need to start hiring today so you won&#39;t be underwater tomorrow.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Talking about inflows and outflows, the evil backlog concept stops making sense finally. Having a big backlog is now meaningless, it&rsquo;s all about how much time it takes to process it (handling times) and within what time can we process it (waiting times). So a new concept starts to crop in into the organisation: service level agreement a.k.a SLA. A SLA is a control mechanism to understand if you&rsquo;re processing tasks within reasonable and acceptable time frames - e.g 80% of emails answered in 24 hours; 90% of Identity Verification tasks reviewed in 1hour; etc. This will be your bar to understand how many people you need to process tasks and within a time frame<br></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c8 c6">&ldquo;OMG we just can&rsquo;t support this headcount!!&#x1f631;&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The knowledge is out! You finally understand how many people you will need to support your SLA&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;ve started doing performance improvement and improved tooling with your new workflow tool but it still seems this is not putting a stop the bleed in cash. This is no longer about how many people you need, it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;my business does not work this way&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is the moment where you indeed need to start to differentiate tasks and understand the underlying reasons of why they are being generated. This means either knowing preemptively or having your workforce categorising these tasks (emails, chats, phone calls, internal tasks). Back in the day this would be relied on the &ldquo;word on the street&rdquo; from your &nbsp;operations workforce, but just as the &ldquo;backlog fight&rdquo; this can go so far. You invest in your systems and processes once again to either understand what a task is about (e.g. customer categorisation, agent categorisation).</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Categorisation of tasks is essential to understand what to prioritise and help the product teams tackling these issues have a good understanding on where they should point their efforts to achieve the biggest outcome possible. This investment unlocks two powerful ways that for you to leverage your workforce:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<ol class="c4 lst-kix_33w968wcozvn-0 start" start="1">
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Decrease inflow of tasks:</span></li>
		</ol>
		<ol class="c4 lst-kix_33w968wcozvn-1 start" start="1">
			<li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Solve bugs and product failures: you&rsquo;ll be able to spot which product failures and bugs are causing the most cost which will help your product team(s) prioritise those issues vs. revenue/growth generating ones.</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Build help resources: you will have more knowledge of what are the frequently asked questions and problems your customers are having so you&rsquo;ll be able in some instances offer them help preemptively as they use your product. (e.g IVR&rsquo;s, help-centers, chat-bots, etc)</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Self-serve: in many cases even you can build into product additional features that enable customers to help themselves without the aid of your workforce.</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<ol class="c4 lst-kix_33w968wcozvn-0" start="2">
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Improve processing of tasks:</span></li>
		</ol>
		<ol class="c4 lst-kix_33w968wcozvn-1 start" start="1">
			<li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Process handling improvements: With the knowledge of the task at hand you can provide customised workflows for your workforce to deal with certain tasks speeding up their efforts and consequently cost.</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Routing &amp; Specialisation: With this knowledge you can start building routing mechanisms that ensure the person who is more efficient can process that type of task. Please bear in mind this requires work of twofold: categorising tasks but also mapping skills and proficiency of your workforce which in itself entails different training, multiple queues and even different hiring. (yes this move duplicates some of the work that before was centralised so you need to know when the benefit defeats the cost to move into this structure.</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are many more ways to go about it. Again I want to recall the piece around maintaining your focus - I&rsquo;m assuming that if you&rsquo;re in a position to make this kind investment it&rsquo;s because cost reduction has become a big key focus of your company. It&rsquo;s better sometimes to leave some inefficiencies alone than to &ldquo;half-ass&rdquo; them.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Where I saw this type of investment really payoff is when companies assign specific product teams to operations tribes/departments - arming the department with cross-functional capabilities. Give them a clear challenge/objective: reduce number of issues/active user, increase the number of tasks processed by hour, and autonomy to solve the problem as they see fit. This kind of focus pays off. Where I saw a really big struggle and drag was when this was treated as a standalone project/epic/lane leaving the department as sort of B2B customer of the product team.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span>Clear objectives, reporting lines and being super close to the ground is key to get this right plus please do consider that this not a &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; it will be continuous improvement that will follow the rest of the life of the company.</span></p>
		<h2 class="c10" id="h.c1k8dgdjblxw"><span class="c8 c6">&ldquo;Why are we still missing our SLA&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span>You&rsquo;ve been able to get costs finally to a place where your business is once again sustainable. For a period of time things seem finally set sail but as your workforce gets bigger you&#39;ve been missing the SLA&rsquo;s again and it&rsquo;s getting more frequent.</span> <span class="c12">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening now? I&rsquo;ve been doing all the things have worked in the past, what is wrong now?&rdquo;</span> <span class="c0">Complaints from customers start to flock in again and once again your NPS is on the line with detractors calling out to your service.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span>In</span> <span class="c12">Darwin to Munger</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there&rsquo;s an excellent excerpt that serves as great metaphor for what&rsquo;s happening:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c12">&ldquo;What about the giants we see in the movies?<br>
		Assume we make a human 10 times larger than normal. This means he is now 10 times longer, 10 times wider, and 10 times higher. He now weighs 1,000 times more but he is only 100 times stronger (as muscular strength is proportional to the cross section area of a muscle). Since the load-bearing capacity of bones scales in the same manner his bones would be subject to ten times more stress than normal. He needs thicker bones to support more weight. Otherwise his legs will crush. This is why elephants have such thick stumpy legs to support their weight. The giant has 1,000 times more meat on the body but only 100 times the skin to hold it together meaning ten times the pressure on its skin (since pressure is proportional to area). This also means that his skin surface area is too small to remove the heat emitted from his huge body. He would suffer from overheating since the amount of heat his body produces is proportional to the cube of his length (1,000), while the amount of heat he dissipates through the skin is proportional to the square of his length (100).&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Long story, but the idea is that things can&rsquo;t scale 10x we expect to have the same &ldquo;physics&rdquo; - to work in the same way. You need to change a bit more.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c20 c3">&ldquo;We just can&rsquo;t hire fast enough &#x1f648;&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ve looked into your forecasts and you&rsquo;re getting the right number of people you need but every month it seems you&rsquo;re not being able to get the people you require. It seems the inflow of tasks that are coming to your company is growing faster, faster than your hiring pipeline can get candidates and train them to competency. You need to scale it.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">There&rsquo;s many ways to go about this but &nbsp;you decide to move the interview processes into batches so you can cut through the time to hire by increasing the pipeline of candidates.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You also start running training and development function as a dedicated centralised function since you&rsquo;re getting dozens of new hires every week and you can&rsquo;t afford taking off people from the frontline to be developing newbies.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This puts things back on track but in the future, you might consider taking this further and even automating some of the first steps of hiring &nbsp;all together and create an e-learning platform to supplement training.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c3 c20">&ldquo;We have the right number of people but we&rsquo;re still missing the SLA&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You have the right number of people and you got the hiring right, but the SLA&rsquo;s seem always behind still. &ldquo;Am I going mad, what the hell is going on?&rdquo;</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can solve this by throwing bodies at the problem (by adding a bit of overcapacity) but this is not good, it promotes idle behaviour which reinforces inefficiency and could cause overall productivity levels go down. Yes, in the past you could add one or two more people into the problem and probably this would be fixed but at this stage this doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">So this is when another terminology starts popping up: Workforce Management. Workforce Management has many shapes and definitions in the industry but I will focus it&rsquo;s main areas into these three: forecast, scheduling and real time management.<br>
		<br>
		You&#39;ve already been adventuring into forecast as we saw earlier to understand how many people we need to hire today to have them ready to process tasks in the near future. Though you&rsquo;ve been unsuccessful in predicting this number since it seems you&rsquo;ve been missing the SLA&rsquo;s. What&rsquo;s off? You start looking into what&rsquo;s happening and you see that repeatedly the number of people you&rsquo;re aiming to process tasks at a given time is lower than the expected ammount. Why is this? You find out: there&rsquo;s people on holidays, people who got sick, people don&rsquo;t show up, people leaving the workforce to other departments or leaving the company and many other factors.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the past these factors could be ignored, but just like the giant, at this size this can&rsquo;t be overlooked. So in your forecast you start estimating all of these factors and at the same time you&rsquo;re also registering holidays, sickness and attrition so you can be more accurate in your predictions. In some cases you will even need to change a bit the rules (again a culture transformation) incentivising holidays in specific times so you can smooth your capacity curves and not rely on overtime or more hiring.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition to this you start to pay more attention to your scheduling too. A slip on one hour of the day could create a disruption wave that affects a whole day. So you start being more precise on how many tasks and which types you get in a specific time frame so you can match with the necessary people with the right skills at the right time. This becomes trickier (and costly) the more you divide task types (more queues) because there will always be a small buffer to compensate for lack of precision so you need to make decisions of which task types you want to group and respectively the workforce that has those skills together. Your routing rules and queue creation in your systems are critical to work hand in hand with this.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">And finally, even with the best long and medium term forecast in the world, you&rsquo;re still seeing slips in the SLA&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s normal, afterall accurate predictions are an oxymoron. Instead of waiting to get the numbers of the past day to react you shorten the feedback loop to the instant. You set up real time analysts looking at live time data that ensures they can move people around tasks to make up for workforce capacity and ensure SLA&rsquo;s are maintained.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">All of these in place finally puts you into a position to finally hit the SLA&rsquo;s. But at what cost? In startups usually their operational people are quite versatile and tend in conjunction with the operational work take quite a few other tasks across the company. With this change the environment will be much restricted to support this type of work, favouring much more specialisation and focus. Be prepared for another culture shift tug of war with the O.G.s of your company.</span></p>
		<h2 class="c10" id="h.xmti5aodvpf9"><span class="c8 c6">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just start outsourcing some of the tasks?&rdquo;</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Things are smooth but you&rsquo;re still in need to improve margins so you start thinking: why does my whole workforce need to be in an expensive country? Can you provide the same type of service level in a different place? The word outsourcing starts to pop up!</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once again, this is one of those culture shift moments in your company. Despite all good intentions, this might be taken quite badly in your company with a big hit on morale. Never underestimate morale in an operational environment, we&rsquo;re not dealing with microservices, we&rsquo;re dealing with people. Plus, attention to culture shocks! If you&rsquo;re opening communication channels between outsourcer workforce and insourced workforce you might be risking a really big culture shock which could result in a nasty immune response from your organisation. This just can&rsquo;t be rushed.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">On another note, outsourcing is usually seen with quite optimism and a lot of planning fallacy. In our minds it just seems like sending tasks to partners and that&rsquo;s it but there are a few complexities that you&rsquo;ll need to manage. You&rsquo;ll need to manage roles and privileges across your internal systems, you&rsquo;ll need to communicate multiple times (assuming the comms are siloed to insource/outsource), you&rsquo;ll have less flexibility in moving some of the workforce due to contracts and lastly you&rsquo;ll have less control on the type of quality of service you provide. Outsourcing can be a powerful ally, but it can also drag your development and kill your flexibility as a company.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Have we gone too far? Our service quality is so bad &#x1f648;&rdquo;</span><span class="c0"><br></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ve achieved great results in leveraging your workforce better. You are scaling effectively your company from dozens to hundreds of people. &#x1f3c6;<br></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your headcount is growing at an acceptable level for your company to be sustainable and it seems the SLA&rsquo;s are in a good place. Though, you are still receiving reports of customers through surveys or angry posts on social media saying your service is crap. &ldquo;The SLA&rsquo;s are ok, so what the hell is going on now? Is this ever going to stop&rdquo;? You start to be worried because this type of word of mouth it&rsquo;s just as dangerous as not being able to serve customers at all.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span>Most likely, along the way you fell victim to Goodhearts Law: &ldquo;</span><span>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&rdquo;</span><span class="c11">.</span> <span class="c0">With the push for productivity and decreasing cost some of those wins might have been at the expense of the customer experience. Customers might be bouncing around multiple people who are processing individual tasks regarding the customer without context, awareness or empathy with the issue at hand.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ve learned with your cost efficiency work in the past and you start from getting the insights you need to focus on this problem:</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<ol class="c4 lst-kix_o7kh663hmmxb-0 start" start="1">
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Pioneering a user research project or service design to map the pain points of customers.</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">You create new rules to bundle tasks together so you can understand end to end the journey of customers and track resolution times and first contact resolution.</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">You create transactional surveys that help to signal any issues regarding a task type.</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">You decide to go even bolder, and create a new task in the system which is effectively to do quality assurance of tasks being processed. This will involve more headcount but you can link to an increase in quality of service which in turn (hopefully) improves retention and growth of your company.</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<h2 class="c10" id="h.alotza5cbxzf"><span class="c8 c6">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do this alone! We need help from the rest of the company &#x1f648;&rdquo;</span></h2>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Quality is tracked and monitored now side by side with performance metrics.Your company keeps growing in business and things seem healthy. Though, you&rsquo;re now into the thousands of agents and multiples task types. &nbsp;Inevitably the complexity is increasing and it&#39;s getting very hard to move the needle as we did before. You&rsquo;ve increased the efficiency of the system to a great point but you also introduced rigidity that makes it hard to work with. Every time the company needs to introduce a new product or change something it&rsquo;s hard to move the &ldquo;tanker&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve created to meet those needs in time.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You decide that is time to move your centralised efforts to a decentralised form. You want to capture the agility from the past but maintain some of the efficiency of the present.</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You find that the best and fastest way to tackle this is to empower the respective teams around the business with the right tools.You enter a new area of scaling operations which is focusing on building the organisation and infrastructure to support the multiple business units and product teams in the company instead of the operations department alone.</span></p>
		<ol class="c4 lst-kix_wm7d2hh2328d-0 start" start="1">
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">You invest in roles in your workforce that serve as liaisons between their teams and the respective product teams/business units. This helps maintaining the communication flowing and a deep link between operations and their product counterpart and give them cross-functional capabilities</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">You provide access to the right data of tasks and train product teams and their liasons to use them so they can make the best decisions regarding their products.</span></li>
			<li class="c2 c7 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">You build your workforce systems and internal tools in a way that they are easy to contribute to and communicate. You want to make sure product teams can deploy solutions for their respective operation teams as smoothly and fast as possible.</span></li>
		</ol>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">You move from being a writer to a sort of an editor to the scaling efforts that multiple teams are doing around their operational counterparts. These efforts make your organisation nimble and autonomous so instead of a &ldquo;giant tanker&rdquo; you have a huge fleet of small boats all moving in the same direction!</span></p>
		<h2 class="c10" id="h.ur40i12ukn0m"><span class="c8 c6">&ldquo;This is just an example. It&rsquo;s even harder&rdquo;<br></span></h2>
		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This story has some sort of continuum and linearity to it (and a bit simplistic). Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not like this. &#x1f648; Usually all of these concerns and ideas are being thrown all the time. Some of those you need to do in parallel, some will be too early to do (never too late maybe).</span></p>
		<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
		<p class="c2"><span>In my experience it&rsquo;s really easy to get lost and try to boil the ocean or get sucked in and try to disrupt something that&rsquo;s not the core focus. Prioritisation, purpose and intentional change are key to getting it done. Understanding sizes of opportunities is key in this work since there will be many right answers though most of them won&rsquo;t be the right time to do them. A good strategy is critical!<br>
